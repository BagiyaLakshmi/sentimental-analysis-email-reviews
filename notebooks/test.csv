2,"Hey Paul,

 

Thanks for the time on the call just now; I appreciate the gesture of chatting with me while making me understand your current position as to moving forward with Revenue Grid.

 

Per Discussed, I have gotten official approval from my Snr Management to extend the current trial of Ecolab (38-Users) Canada until the end of June 2021, pending once we understand where the Global team stands on this; I do have a quick favor, though?

 

As we wait, could we start making sure of the necessary due diligence such as NDA and other procurement and risk assessment phases?

4,"Hello Momin,

 

To follow up on our last call, would you be able to set up a demo of revenue inbox (not revenue grid only the inbox function) for Daniel, Tim, Jan and Flemming who are EU Sales managers or service managers?

Can you please make sure you can functionalities on a mobile phone and on a computer?

 

If you could suggest 2 or 3 timeslots so we can see what fits best.

 

Thanks for your help,

5,"Hi Bachana & team,

 

Thank you so much for all the work you have done to accommodate our legal requirements. We really appreciate that.

 

However, with the new suggested approach we need to have some discussions with global IT management and therefore we would need to postpone our onboarding session on Tuesday. I will get back to you when I have more information to share.

8,"Hi Momin,

Please see signed agreement attached. I wanted to send this to you so that we can lock in the pricing however some of the company details are incorrect so we'll need a new copy. 

I will send the correct details in the morning, sorry I'm on the road right now.

Thank you and Roman for the offer. I know William is keen to chat to your team about the prep so we'll organise a call for later in the week.

Thank you very much for your mail.

Indeed, the presentation made by you was very impressive and was appreciated by most. At the same time, there are divided opinions about when we should go in for the Revenue Grid Suite. Hence please allow us some more time to discuss this matter internally and come to a consensus. We will revert to you soon thereafter. Kindly bear.


Thanks, and Regards"

19,"Hi Thomas, are you working with any New York Life agents currently that are using the “Sales Central” version of Sales force? It is the New York Life version and most integrations don’t work due to compliance issues with company. If you have a work around that you are currently using with other New York Life advisors please let me w and I would be interested in talking more…

Thank you for contacting me and following up on this.

 

Michael, since you are in charge of the NE SF set up, I hope it is ok with you to have a talk with Ali to discuss possibilities using Revenue Inbox.

Ali is not out to sell anything to us, just helping us using the systems better.

 

I hope this is relevant Michael.

Thanks."
32,Disregard last email. I didn't realize you sent it.

34,"Hello Olga,

 

Thanks for the follow-up.

 

I successfully installed the app, but I am yet to use it – I’ve been side-tracked on other tasks.

 

I’ll let you know how I go with using it – I’m sure I’ll have the odd question."

Happy to help.  Feel free to give me a call – 901-495-3145.  Thanks."
38,Not a problem…either way is fine.
39,"I hope that you do too, Victor! Thank you!"
40,"Hello Anastacia,

We weren't informed of the name change on the company and your email domain, so these messages didn't make it past our spam filter.

We haven't used the product in the past year, and don't see a need for it going forward. 

I've been instructed to inform you that we will be disputing the charge as fraudulent and will be cancelling the card outright if we aren't able to refund the charges. 

Can we please cancel the subscription and begin the refund process? 
"
41,"Hi Femi and Support,

 

Please cancel our account and provide confirmation that this has been actioned.

 

The reason for cancellation is that this product has fallen short of expectations both in capability as well as support, and we have since found and implemented an alternative solution.

 "
42,Please remove me from your mailing lists 
43,"Hi Roman – sure thing. See screenshot below:

(quick note – only Jodi Stanley seems to be having this issue)"
44,"Hi Kirill,

I'll check with Joe and will get back to you
"
45,"Thanks Alex, I appreciate the background.

 

We do not currently have a need for something like Revenue Grid. I will reach out if anything changes in the future."
46,Thanks Eugene.
47,Can we set up a call?
48,"Thanks Daryna. Please include the PO number: PO-U002-L002 in the link and confirm

 

Angelina – can you please process this so we can activate the licenses for Sam, Abi and Rachel? It should be $17.50 x 3 per month"
49,Great. Booked Wednesday(07/07)@ 9:30 AM ET. Let me know if you have any questions meanwhile.
50,"Hi Sergey,

 

I have booked this in for next Tuesday at 11:30."
51,"Hello,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

I am currently on maternity leave, returning April 2021.

 

Please either contact Piya Harris, Assistant Manager of Business Services, on pharris@huonit.com.au, or call the office on 1300 HUON IT."
52,"I would like to replace the user Brendan@DrewettRealEstate.com with Hayes@DrewettRealEstate.com

55,"Hi Natalia ,

Sure. We will add another license. "
56,"That doesn’t seem to open anything. If it is a zoom meeting could you just give me the meeting ID and the password?

"
57,"Hi Kirill,

Thanks, hope you’re good too!

I don’t use the tool, you can delete me. Thanks!"
58,"Hi,

 

We are fine… We are making changes and may not continue with Jungo or Revenue Grid.

 

I won’t need anymore emails on set up at this time!"
59,"Mary / Lori – can you give Femi an update?

 

Femi – it turned out I must have lost the invoice between working from home and the office.  It was approved on 6/22 so I image it will go out in next weeks check run if it already wasn;t sent.

 

Have a great weekend."
60,"Can I meant to ask you to confirm whom these licenses are assigned to

 

bmcdonald@axiamed.com

kkidd@axiamed.com"
61,"You can close the ticket. We already renewed and don’t need any support. Thank you.

"
62,"Hello!

 

Sad to say, but Evolve is no longer in need of the email attaching feature through Revenue Inbox. We will continue to use the calendar syncing feature for the time being, though.

 

Can you provide a list of all the licenses we have and who they are for? I will need to remove licenses for a number of people who don’t use the calendar syncing feature.

 

Thank you!"
63,"Lauren or Amy- can you please make payment for this?

Thanks!
"
64,"Femi,

I’ve given you and Revenue Grid proper notice of our intent to terminate.  I am not in a position to introduce you to internal software acquisition decision makers.  Please simply term our service at the end of contract and cease reaching out to either myself or my team members."
65,It works! Thank you very much.
66,It seems the attachments are not saving. Anything special we need to do to activate this?
67,"Olga, 

I only see 11:30 available today. Is there any other availability this afternoon?
"
68,"Hi Vadym,

 

I received approval from our accounting team to pay the invoice with the corporate cc.

 

Please send me an invoice first and the link again.

 "
69,"Good Morning, I have processed the payment for the invoice. How do I assign users to the seats?"
70,"Thanks for the below, I have contacted Katie and Toby and they should be signing back in shorty.

 

I was actually looking to get in touch as we have 3 new starts so I would be looking for what I believe would just be one new licence. From the below Patrick Burns is leaving this week and Ricky Patel has left already so would like to use those two licenses for the newcomers. Can you please can confirm that its just one licence that we need. Please can you also send over an invoice for this."
71,"I will be out of the office with very limited access to email or voicemail until Monday, May 1st.

 

Unless your matter is urgent, I will respond to your email upon my return.

 

Thank you very much."
72,I am so sorry.  I had some issues this morning and rescheduled for 9:30.  My bad. 
73,"Hi Alex,

 

Thanks for this. Perfect."
74,"We haven't been using the product. 

Sophie and Trung left Cavirin a long time ago...our contract was supposed to expire in June 2019"
75,No thank you.
76,"Thanks, all is well. The name change threw us all."
77,"Good Morning, I have processed the payment for the invoice. How do I assign users to the seats?"
78,"Hi Kirill,

 

I apologize for the late response.

 

I am waiting for our salesperson to be back in the office and available so I can add SmartCloud to his email, but I was able to access the admin portal. Thank you for your help."
79,Thank you!
80,Thanks I think we are good!
81,"HI Olga,

 

We have now three members of the team joining us.

Daryl Midford joining 28 June license should be under email daryl.midford@azrcapital.com

Would be great to speak perhaps to understand the pricing for all 5 of us now. Send me your latest offers as we are at the stage of exploring what provider we use now that the team is bigger.

83,"Alex,
That was my first attempt to get a hold of you to talk about this subscription that I didn’t want.
I saw it up for renewal and wanted to tell you to cancel it."
84,"Hi Nataliia,

Apologies for not getting back to you sooner. Will has indeed left the business and can have his user removed."

91,Thanks Daryna – you too!
92,"Hello,

 

I spoke with Colin and we will not need to renew at this time."
93,Sorry Alex – could you also explain why the pricing has increased from $360 to $480 when the service offering remains unchanged?
94,"Hi Eugene,

 

Thank you for sending through the invoice.

Handed over to accounts for payment next week.

 "
95,"Sergey, it’s working.  Thanks. Feel free to close the ticket."
96,"Hi Dmytrii,

Thanks for the links related to the Lightning Scheduler and ‘Book Me’ feature. I would like to schedule a call for the demo of these features. Also, I have few other questions related to Revenue Inbox. I am not able to find the answers in the knowledge base.

Please tell me the best time."
97,"Hi Daryna,

 

No worries – if we stay with Salesforce we will certainly reactivate the account.

 

To answer your other question, senior management does not see the value in Salesforce and feels it is “too much” for what we need.  The system was never set up properly and that has made it difficult for them to see the value.

 

I believe that Salesforce is the best option and am trying to convince them of that – and I hope I am successful."
98,"John, can you send some screen shots of what you’re seeing on your RevenueGrid side panel in outlook? Also, are you using the desktop version of Outlook or the browser version? I’m not sure the side panel is compatible with the browser version (Ivan please correct me if this is wrong)."
99,"Lyn Pagett is no longer working for Senstar, please contact simon.webster@senstar.com for assistance"
